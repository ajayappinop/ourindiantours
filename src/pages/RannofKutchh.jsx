              <p>The Rann of Kutch is located mostly in the Indian state of Gujarat. The word Rann means “brackish desert”. The Rann covers around 26,000 square kilometres area. Both the Ranns are independent entities though joined by a road bridge over an estuary like habitat.</p>
              <p>The Rann of Kutch enables various ecosystems. Its grasslands are home to forms of wildlife that have adapted to its often harsh conditions. These include endemic and endangered species of fauna and flora. The non-native tree Prosopis juliflora has become established on the ‘bets’, and its seed pods provide year-round food for the Wild Ass. Your days in the Rann will take in various species of birds, mammals and terrain, so you take in something of the sheer space and scale of this remarkable land.</p>
              <p>About 300 bird species and 40 mammals have been recorded in the Little Rann. The habitat remains partly inundated during winter, which helps maintain a rich and varied diet -- insects, planktons, molluscs, fish – for a great variety of bird species. It is the largest breeding ground for Lesser Flamingos in India. Our target species will be: Short-eared Owl, Courser (Cream-coloured and Indian), Hoopoe Lark, MacQueen’s Bustard, Sociable Lapwing, Collared Pratincole, Red-necked Phalarope, Spotted Sandgrouse, Harriers (Marsh, Pallid and Montagu’s), Peregrine Falcon, Greater Spotted Eagle, Vultures, and Wheatears among others. It is an easy paced tour using a 4×4 jeep during morning and afternoon in Little Rann and walking around to add to you bird list.</p>
              <p>The Greater Rann is accessible from Moti Virani, where we will stay at a B&B, the only accommodation in that area. It is vast brackish and semi-arid habitat noted for globally threatened species like Stoliczka’s Bush Chat and White-naped Tit. Black Francolin, Syke’s Crested Lark, Grey-necked Tit, Common Iora, Painted Sandgrouse, Small Minivet, among others will receive our attention. Tawny and Bonelli’s Eagles breed there. We will drive and then walk around water bodies and hilly areas to better spot birds. The naturalist will guide us and answer our questions. We will wait at burrows to have a glimpse of some nocturnal mammals like Indian and White-footed Fox, Jackal, Wolf, etc. We will target the most elusive Gray Hypocolis. We will log in sea birds on the last day when we will drive to Mandvi prior to taking an overnight train to Ahmedabad.</p>
