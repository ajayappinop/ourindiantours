              <p>The Western Ghats are internationally recognized as a region of immense global importance for the conservation of biological diversity, besides containing areas of high geological, cultural and aesthetic values. A chain of mountains running parallel to India’s western coast, approximately 30-50 km inland, the Ghats traverse the States of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Goa, Maharashtra and Gujarat. They cover an area of 62,000 sq., miles. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This mountain chain is recognized as one of the world’s eight ‘hottest hotspots’ of biological diversity along with Sri Lanka. The forests of the Western Ghats include some of the best representatives of non-equatorial tropical evergreen forests in the world.</p>
              <p><strong>Global concern: </strong>At least 325 globally threatened species occur in the Western Ghats. The globally threatened flora and fauna in the Western Ghats are represented by 229 plant species, 31 mammal species, 15 bird species, 43 amphibian species, 5 reptile species and 1 fish species. Of these, 129 are classified as Vulnerable, 145 as Endangered and 51 as Critically Endangered. It has maximum number of bird species endemic to the Western Ghats.</p>
              <p>The Western Ghats are home to some 17 percent of the world’s Tigers and about 30 percent of the world’s Asian Elephants. Approximately 245 million people live in the peninsular Indian states that receive most of their water supply from rivers originating in the Western Ghats. This tour is especially designed to offer rare and endemic bird species of the southern Western Ghats by visiting Periyar, Munnar, Valparai and Thattekad, areas falling in states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu in India.</p>
