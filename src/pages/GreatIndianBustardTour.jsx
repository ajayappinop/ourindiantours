              <p>The Thar Desert is home to the last surviving population of Great Indian Bustards. With fewer than 115 birds left in the wild, your visit is especially designed to give you good sightings of these birds, and instead of disturbing their habitat you will come to understand it. You will be working with expert, trained local guides who dedicate their lives to conserving the birds, animals and flora of this extreme yet rich habitat.</p>
              <p>Our trip takes in the Desert National Park, with its wide mix of habitats from water bodies, grasslands, rocky terrain and desert scrub. The Park has recorded over 250 species. Our own tour takes place October to March, outside of the desert’s extreme heat and the July-September breeding period for the Great Indian Bustard. The winter and early spring is a good time for migratory species including raptors, wheatear, MacQueen’s Bustard, and Sandgrouse (flocks of the Chestnut-bellied but also hopefully the Black-bellied and Spotted). Expect to see vast flocks of larks: Greater short-toed, Bimacilated and Black-crowned Sparrow Larks.</p>
              <p>Your days in the desert will take in various species of birds, mammals and terrain, at select times and locations from dawn to dusk, so you take in something of the sheer space and scale of this remarkable land. You will meet the people who care to conserve it: the teams of scientists working to save the GIB from extinction, and the locals who do the same.</p>
              <p>The GIB look for their food in land shared with humans. Your local guide, armed with a spotting scope, has shared his whole life with these birds. Your days with him ensure you achieve more than a glimpse of some of the largest birds of flight in the world – you will experience the stark beauty and the challenges of their life and habitat. It is easy-paced using a vehicle throughout, a 4×4 jeep while in the Desert National Park. Expect about 80 species of birds to be observed.</p>
              <p>Our tour includes options to tour the fabled city of Jaisalmer, a medieval wonder including the alleyways and minarets of its hilltop fort. We can include excursions by camel into the desert dunes, and extend the trip to leopard safaris and overwintering crowds of Demoiselle Cranes.</p>

Spend sun-set by side of a sand dune. An expert from Wildlife Institute of India can join for drinks and dinner to share his experiences with the desert birds especially ex situ breeding of Great Indian Bustard started in 2019.
