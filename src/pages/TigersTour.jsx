              <p>The year 2023-24 marked the 50th anniversary of Project Tiger. Let us get enthralled with success of this most remarkable conservation programmes across the globe – visiting Tiger Reserves in India.</p>
              <p>The 1960s saw tigers in deep crisis – hunting all over India was rampant and their recovery rate plummeted. The 1969 IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) raised alerts and in 1970 India imposed a total ban on hunting tigers. It marked a turning point.</p>
              <p>Project Tiger’s formal launch was in 1973, at nine especially designated forests in the country. </p>
              <p>Prime amongst these is the base for our trip: Ranthambhore, which has gained a reputation as a vital breeding ground. Opening with a dozen tigers, it has survived the challenges of its first decades in which its size has grown from 400 sq. km to 1,200 sq. km. Currently its tiger population is estimated at seventy.</p>
              <p>Three days of jeep safaris, accompanied by trained and local naturalists to allow you good sightings, will take you up close and personal with the tigers: well, as close as it’s feasible to be with these fierce, magnificent creatures. You’ll become intimate with their habitat.</p>
              <p>The tour extends into a bird watching excursion in India’s top birding site, Keoladeo National Park, a UNESCO and Ramsar Site, a renowned heronry and wintering ground for migratory birds, using a bicycle rickshaw and assisted by an expert bird guide.</p>
              <p>After these top Indian wildlife sites, we end the tour with a visit to perhaps the most fabled tourist destination in the world – the Taj Mahal– before your return flight to Delhi.</p>

                <p><strong>01 Day. New Delhi – Sawai Madhopur (Ranthambhore Tiger Reserve). </strong>Welcome on arrival at airport. Proceed to railway station (40 min) to board connecting a/c train.

              <div className='itinerary-card mt-3'>
                <p><strong>02 – 03 – 04 Days. Sawai Madhopur (Ranthambhore Tiger Reserve). </strong>We will have morning (6.30 to 10 am) and afternoon (2.30 to 6 pm) jeep safaris each day with a knowledgeable nature guide and versatile driver. We will adopt different routes to take in information from fresh reports of tiger sighting. Thrill at watching Sambhar, Spotted deer, Blue Bull, Wild Boar, Mongoose, Marsh Crocodile, amidst a flutter of some 100 bird species, Owls out in the day, Indian Thick-knee by the edge of water and peacocks all around. And wait for the Tiger or Leopard or Sloth Bear to come face to face with you. Raj Bag, Padam Talab, Malik Talab, Lakarda, Bherda, Jhalra, Tamba Khan, Naal Ghati, Phuta Khurra are the most promising habitats where sightings are prominent. An ancient fort stands amidst this forest where the first self-sacrifice by Rajput ladies took place in 12th century. These are easy-paced safaris but we need to cover ours faces sometimes to avoid dirt raised by moving jeeps. For morning safaris we like to carry blankets from rooms to save ourselves from extreme cold and fog. A woollen cap is recommended. Overnight.</p>
